INSTRUCTIONS = """\
hypruse controls a live Hyprland desktop. Workflow: call `desktop` first
and prefer `hypr`/`launch` (IPC, instant and exact) for anything window-
or workspace-shaped; use `screenshot` + `pointer`/`keyboard` only to see
and operate inside application windows. Launchers, bars, notification
popups, and on-screen keyboards are not windows: `desktop` reports them
under `layers`. A listed layer is one the compositor tracks, not one you
can see: it may be transparent or dormant, so `screenshot` when visibility
matters. To CLICK a named control inside an app, call `click_ui` FIRST:
for GTK/Qt apps it resolves the control in the accessibility tree and
clicks it in ONE call, no image and no pixel estimation (`ui` lists the
controls and their current values without clicking; `marks` returns a
numbered screenshot plus legend when you want to SEE what is clickable,
then `click_ui(mark=N)`). Use screenshot + zoom when the tree exposes
nothing (terminals, canvas UIs, Electron/Chrome without a flag). To
verify an effect without a second round-trip, pass `then='desktop'` (a
fresh snapshot), `then='ui'` (controls with current values, cheapest
after typing or toggling: the focused window, or for `click_ui` the
window it just clicked), or `then='screenshot'` to
the acting call itself instead of calling `desktop` again. `binds` lists
the owner's own keybinds; to run one, call
`use_bind` with its combo (synthetic keypresses do NOT trigger compositor
binds, so `keyboard` is only for shortcuts the focused app handles). After
actions with delayed effects, block on `wait_for` (window_open,
title_change, layer_open) instead of sleeping. To run several actions at
once (click, type, press enter, wait), pass them to `sequence` as one
call: it stops if
the desktop changes structurally between steps, so you spend one
round-trip instead of one per step. It does not catch a bare focus change,
so give a keyboard step a window= address when typing matters.

Coordinates: one space everywhere, Hyprland global logical pixels (window
`at`, cursor, clicks). Screenshots are pixel space: map back with
global = geometry[:2] + image_pixel / scale, using the metadata's `scale`
and `image` [w,h] (they already account for any downscaling). When
screenshot returns a file path instead of an image, read that file.

Clicking precisely is hard: estimating a target's pixel from a full-screen
image is only accurate to within tens of pixels, which misses small
controls. For anything small, work coarse-to-fine: screenshot the window,
estimate the target's global point, then call `zoom` at that point and
re-estimate on the zoomed image before clicking. Zoomed captures come back
near 1:1 (scale ~1.0) with the target large and their origin in `geometry`,
so global = geometry[:2] + image_pixel lands cleanly. Estimate by
proportion (e.g. "60% across a 300px-wide crop → x≈180"), not absolute
guessing, and after a click that should change something, screenshot again
to confirm before continuing (stable=true waits out animations).

The cursor and keyboard focus are SHARED with the human at the desk:
finish what you start, and expect every action to be visible. Before
typing, pass `keyboard(window=<address>)` to focus the intended app first,
so keystrokes never land in the wrong window."""

READONLY_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
hypruse is attached to a live Hyprland desktop in READ-ONLY MODE: the
user enabled observation only, so the tools listed here are the whole
surface. hypruse cannot move the cursor, type, press keys, run
programs, or rearrange anything in this mode; the human at the desk
drives, hypruse watches and reports.

Workflow: call `desktop` first for the semantic state: monitors,
workspaces, windows (address, class, title, `at` + `size` in global
coords), the active window, cursor, and `layers` (launchers, bars,
notification popups, and on-screen keyboards are not windows and
appear only there). A listed layer is one the compositor tracks, not one
you can see: it may be transparent or dormant, so confirm with a
`screenshot` rather than inferring visibility from presence. To read what
an app shows, prefer `ui` (its accessibility tree: control names with
CURRENT values, a few hundred exact tokens and no image) when the app
exposes one; `marks` adds a numbered screenshot plus legend when you want
to SEE the controls. Use
`screenshot` (focused monitor, a window, or a region) and `zoom` (a
native-resolution crop around a point) when the tree exposes nothing
(terminals, canvas UIs, Electron/Chrome without a flag). `binds`
lists the owner's own keybinds, useful for understanding their
workflows. To notice a change (an app starting, a title updating, a
layer appearing), block on `wait_for` instead of re-capturing in a
loop.

Coordinates: one space everywhere, Hyprland global logical pixels
(window `at`, cursor). Screenshots are pixel space: map back with
global = geometry[:2] + image_pixel / scale, using the metadata's
`scale` and `image` [w,h] (they already account for any downscaling).

    a bare focus change, so to type into a specific window reliably give
