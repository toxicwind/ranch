"""Thin layer over Hyprland's hyprctl IPC.

Everything hypruse knows about the desktop comes through here, and every
workspace/window action goes back out through dispatch(). It shells out to
the hyprctl binary rather than opening the .socket directly so behaviour
always matches what the user's own shell would do.

Hyprland 0.56 shipped a second config manager, and which one a session runs
changes the IPC, not just how the config is written: under the Lua manager
`hyprctl dispatch` evaluates its argument as a Lua expression and `hyprctl
keyword` is refused outright. It is chosen by the config file's EXTENSION,
so it is not something a version check can answer. provider() probes it and
the rest of this module speaks whichever language came back.

Coordinates everywhere in hypruse are Hyprland's global *logical* layout
coordinates, the same space `hyprctl cursorpos`, client `at`, and cursor
positioning use.

# looked for BEFORE `hyprland.conf`, a fresh install is given a .lua, and
# safe mode always boots one. That choice reaches the IPC. Under the Lua
# manager `hyprctl dispatch X` is a shorthand for evaluating the Lua
# expression `hl.dispatch(X)`, so a legacy dispatcher string like
# `movecursor 100 100` is a syntax error, and `hyprctl keyword` answers
# "keyword can't work with non-legacy parsers. Use eval." The hyprlang
# manager is untouched, including on 0.56, which is why this is a provider
