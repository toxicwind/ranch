"""Synthetic input.

Pointer: positioning goes through the compositor's cursor dispatcher (global
logical coordinates, authoritative on any monitor layout); only button and
axis events go through the virtual-pointer wire client. This split
sidesteps the known multi-monitor mapping bugs of absolute virtual-pointer
motion (hyprwm/Hyprland#6749).

Keyboard: wtype, which uploads its own XKB keymap over
zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1, text lands layout-correct including unicode,
with no uinput scancode guessing.
