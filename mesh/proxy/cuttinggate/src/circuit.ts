/**
 * Per-provider circuit breaking and rate limiting.
 *
 * Two failure modes, two mechanisms, one rule: neither may be bypassed.
 *
 * The breaker (`opossum`) stops us hammering a provider that is down. It opens
 * only after `breakerThreshold` calls inside the rolling window have ALL
 * failed (volumeThreshold + 100% error rate), so one blip cannot trip it.
 * Its own timeout is a backstop, NOT the per-attempt deadline: the Router's
 * AbortSignals fire first. (The previous build reused breakerResetMs (15s) as
 * the call timeout, which killed every completion slower than 15s.)
 *
 * The limiter (`bottleneck`) is a fixed-window RPM ceiling: the reservoir
 * refills to `rpm` every 60s. (The previous build set a reservoir with no
 * refresh, so a provider with *_RPM configured stalled forever after `rpm`
 * calls.)
 *
 * Both are keyed by provider so one provider's outage never degrades
 * another's path.
