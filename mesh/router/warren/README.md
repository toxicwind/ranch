*The trust boundary in front of upstream MCP servers: per-upstream circuit breakers quarantine poisoned servers while agents see one provenance-namespaced tool union.*

## Why this exists

Agents call tools; tools come from upstream MCP servers; upstream servers can be poisoned. This gateway sits between: it quarantines misbehaving upstreams, pins sticky sessions on `notifications/initialized`, and serves `tools/list` as a provenance-namespaced union (`<upstream>__<tool>`) with 502 failover. The routing theory (ReAct 2210.03629 / Reflexion 2303.11366) is documented in `gateway-core.ts`.

## Status

**Not live.** The code defaults to `:25120`, but that port is canonically sovereign-chat's per `estate/pitchfork.toml` — do not start the gateway on `:25120` without resolving the collision. No pitchfork stanza, nothing listening. Preserved for reference; MCP federation on the estate is gatehouse's domain (`barn/gatehouse`, `:25127`).

## Layout

```text
gateway.ts          HTTP entry — thin Bun.serve wrapper (MCP_GATEWAY_PORT, default 25120)
gateway-core.ts     the testable core: circuits, sticky sessions, upstream selection,
                    provenance-namespaced tools/list union, health snapshots
gateway-core.test.ts  bun test suite
```
