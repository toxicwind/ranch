## ⚡ Speculative Learning

Every LLM router hedges. Fire K candidates in parallel, take the first success, abort the rest.

**Every one of them discards the losers.**

This one observes them.

A loser that returned headers before the abort is a right-censored latency observation. A loser that returned a `429` is a recovery observation. A loser that returned the first token is a partial-quality observation. Feed these back into the posterior, and **every user request becomes K exploration events instead of 1**.

The exploration tax drops to zero. The probes were already in flight. You were going to abort them anyway. The only change is that you observe them first.

> **3 observations per request. 0 additional milliseconds.**

This is the entire contribution. Everything else in this repository is infrastructure in service of it.

```

thompson     → 1 obs / request,  +exploration tax
speculative  → K obs / request,  0 extra ms

The hedge fires K probes. K−1 die. All K are observed.

### The Mechanism

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant R as Router
    participant A as Provider A
    participant B as Provider B
    participant C2 as Provider C

    C->>R: chat.completions
    R->>R: classifyTask → leaf path
    R->>R: rankedPairs → K=3

    par hedge race
        R->>A: probe (t+0ms)
        R->>B: probe (t+100ms)
        R->>C2: probe (t+200ms)
    end

    A-->>R: 200 SSE (headers)
    Note over R: A wins. Observe A full weight.
    R->>B: abort() → observe partial
    R->>C2: abort() → observe partial

    Note over R,B,C2: β += 0.3 for headers<br/>β += 0.6 for first token<br/>shape_rec += 1 for 429

    R-->>C: stream A

## 📊 Benchmark

**100 requests · 5 heterogeneous providers · identical workload · seed=1**

| Router | p50 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Convergence | Observations | Cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `monk` (fixed best) | 77.5 | 312.4 | never | 100 | $0.42 |
| `luddite` (round-robin) | 92.1 | 401.8 | never | 100 | $0.51 |
| `llm-hedge` alone  | **38.5** | 288.9 | **28 rounds** | 100 | $0.71 |
| `bayesroute` alone  | 77.5 | 282.3 | >50 rounds | 100 | $0.38 |
| `gaslight` (posterior unread) | 61.2 | 298.1 | never | 300 | $0.63 |
| **stoat** | **22.7** | **213.7** | **2 rounds** | **300** | $0.71 |

<details>
<summary><b>Reading the table</b></summary>

- **`gaslight`** writes the posterior but reads `Math.random()` for the score. It fires K=3 probes and observes all 3, but the observations are never used. If `gaslight` matched the champion, the belief field would be decorative. It does not match — the champion is 37% faster at p50 and 28% faster at p99. The posterior is doing work.
- **`monk`** never learns. It stays on the first-ranked arm forever. It is the baseline any router must beat.
- **`llm-hedge` alone** hedges well but never learns. Its p50 is the hedge floor. Its convergence is slow because it only observes the winner.
- **`bayesroute` alone** learns well but fires one arm per request. Its p99 is bad because it does not hedge. Its convergence is slow because it only observes one arm per request.
- **stoat** hits the hedge floor *and* converges in 2 rounds because it observes 3 arms per request.

</details>

> ⚠️ **Honest caveat.** The current observation fires at SSE headers, not stream close. The `e_lat` values for some arms are lower than the true end-to-end latency. The p99 column is trustworthy; the min/median are optimistic. See [#14](https://github.com/toxicwind/stoat/issues/14).

<details>
<summary><b>L1 — Cryptographic Verification (planned)</b></summary>

When a provider returns an [Attested Inference Receipt](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tsyrulnikov-air/), verify the COSE_Sign1 envelope before accepting the response. AIR binds model identity and third-party verification to a single inference event .

Currently stubbed. Requires provider-side adoption.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>L2 — Behavioral Fingerprinting (shipped)</b></summary>

`verifySingleTokenFingerprint(provider, token)` compares the returned token against the expected distribution for that provider. Divergence above threshold demotes the arm in the belief field — not disable, demote. The endpoint may be legitimately degraded, not substituted.

Based on [Who Is Behind the Harness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.28559)  and [Evidence-Bound Gateway-Path Provenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.22560) .
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>L3 — Hierarchical Bayesian State (shipped)</b></summary>

Each `(provider, model, task_path)` arm carries:

```typescript
interface BeliefNode {
  successes: number;   // Beta α − 1
  failures: number;    // Beta β − 1
  e_lat: number;       // Gamma mean latency
  e_tps: number;       // Gamma mean throughput
  shape_rec: number;   // recovery Gamma shape
  rate_rec: number;    // recovery Gamma rate
  t: number;           // last observation timestamp
}
```

The score samples all four posteriors:

```
score = w_q · sampleBeta(α, β)
      − w_l · sampleGamma(shape_lat, rate_lat)
      − w_c · sampleGamma(shape_cost, rate_cost)
      − w_r · sampleGamma(shape_rec, rate_rec)
```

Decay is applied on read with a 5-minute half-life . Per-bucket keying from [ruflo ADR-142](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo) .
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>L4 — Token Inflation Auditor (shipped)</b></summary>

`auditTokenInflation(reportedTokens, outputChars)` returns `{ ratio, inflated }`. A ratio above 4 chars/token is physically suspicious for English text.

Based on [CANON Engine](https://zenodo.org/records/17518395) , which analyzed 80,000 production traces and found 6 classes of silent failures including cost spikes and schema mismatch.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>L5 — Cache Timing Sanitizer (shipped)</b></summary>

`sanitizeCacheTiming(ms)` adds jitter to TTFT to break the prefix-cache timing oracle described in [CVE-2025-46570](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46570).

`padPromptToCacheFloor(prompt, floor)` pads short prompts with filler tokens to reach the cache floor, avoiding the "cache tax" where English pays more than other languages.

## 🤝 Contributing

Every layer has a `STATUS` in the table above. If a layer says `planned`, the PR that ships it is welcome. If it says `shipped`, the PR that adds a test is welcome.

The race harness is the contribution mechanism. Fork a variant, run the benchmark, submit the `results.json`. If your variant is non-dominated on the Pareto front, it becomes a new row in the benchmark table.

```bash
# Add a variant
cp -r variants/_base variants/your-variant
# Edit variants/your-variant/variant.toml
# Run the race
bun race/run.ts --variant your-variant --seed 1
```
