# Firefox enterprise policies

> Managed `/etc/firefox/policies/` for the yote box — deployed, not hand-edited.

> **Why care? Chris's requirement: no experiments, no studies, no in-browser update fights — while security/update collections keep working. These policies are source-traced to mozilla-central, so every claim about what a policy does (and doesn't touch) is verifiable, not folklore.**

- **`DisableAppUpdate` — updates come from `pacman -Syu`, never the browser**
- **`DisableFirefoxStudies` — kills Nimbus experiments/rollouts, preserves Remote Settings sync + Normandy emergency remediation**
- **Source-traced — every behavior claim cites `file:line` in mozilla-central**
- **Deployed by `firefox-rs-repair.sh` — pacman hook + path unit re-apply after upgrades**

## Quick start

```bash
cd projects/yote/ops/firefox-policies
./firefox-rs-repair.sh --install   # deploy policies (do not hand-edit on the box)
./firefox-rs-repair.sh --repair    # re-assert after drift
```

## License & security

- **License:** [MIT](https://github.com/toxicwind/sovereign-projects#license)
- **Security:** Policies are the security boundary for the browser on this box: no studies enrolled, no silent experiments. Change the repo source and re-run the script — never hand-edit `/etc/firefox/policies/` on the box.

---

Deployed from `projects/yote/ops/firefox-policies/` by `firefox-rs-repair.sh`
(`--install` / `--repair`). Do not hand-edit on the box; change the repo
source and re-run the script (or let the pacman hook / path unit re-apply it).

## Current policies

| Policy | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `DisableAppUpdate` | `true` | This box runs `firefox-nightly` from pacman. In-browser updates would fight the package manager and can leave a half-updated install. Updates come from `pacman -Syu`; the `firefox-rs-repair` pacman hook re-applies this repair after every upgrade. |

## SET: `DisableFirefoxStudies` — source-traced, 2026-09-21

Chris's requirement: no experiments/studies enrolled, Remote Settings
security/update collections keep working, emergency remediation preserved if
separable from experimentation. The mozilla-central trace (gecko-dev master,
all citations file:line) says this policy delivers exactly that:

**What it does** — `browser/components/enterprisepolicies/Policies.sys.mjs:933-948`:
calls `manager.disallowFeature("Shield")` and locks the two CFR new-tab prefs
(`browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.userprefs.cfr.addons`,
`...cfr.features`) off.

**What "Shield" gates** — the ONLY consumer of the feature string is
`ExperimentAPI.studiesEnabled`
(`toolkit/components/nimbus/ExperimentAPI.sys.mjs:308-314`), which ANDs
`datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled`,
`app.shield.optoutstudies.enabled`, and `Services.policies.isAllowed("Shield")`.
With the policy set, `studiesEnabled` is false, which:
- refuses to start `RemoteSettingsExperimentLoader`
  (`RemoteSettingsExperimentLoader.sys.mjs:247-252`),
- unenrolls EVERY active experiment AND rollout with reason `STUDIES_OPT_OUT`
  (`ExperimentManager.sys.mjs:890+`, reliably awaited since Bug 1969309),
- blocks force-enroll (`RemoteSettingsExperimentLoader.sys.mjs:584-588`).

So: Nimbus experiments, rollouts, secure experiments, and messaging
experiments are all dead — enrolled or future.

**What it does NOT touch:**
- Remote Settings syncs: zero occurrences of `studiesEnabled`/`isAllowed`/
  `Shield` in `services/settings/remote-settings.sys.mjs` (753 lines) or
  `RemoteSettingsClient.sys.mjs` (1370 lines) — grep-verified. Blocklists,
  OneCRL/cert-revocation, hijack blocklists, and `normandy-recipes-capabilities`
  keep syncing on their normal poll. There is no `services.settings.enabled`
  kill-switch; the layers are fully orthogonal.
- Normandy emergency remediation: `Normandy.sys.mjs:137` calls
  `RecipeRunner.init()` unconditionally; the runner gates only on
  `app.normandy.enabled` (default true, `firefox.js:2738`) and a valid https
  `app.normandy.api_url` (`RecipeRunner.sys.mjs:198-225`) — no
  `Services.policies` reference anywhere in the runner. The recipe path
  (6h timer, `normandy-recipes-capabilities` RS collection, add-on rollout
  actions) survives the policy. This is the separable emergency path.

**History:** the policy body is untouched since ~2020 (800-commit scan of
`Policies.sys.mjs` found nothing); 2025 changes (Bug 1950237 live opt-out
observers, Bug 1969309 awaited unenroll) only strengthened the kill. The
"Shield" string's meaning migrated from the Normandy era to Nimbus-only —
which is why the emergency path survives.

**Empirical check** (proves the emergency path is healthy): watch
`services.settings.last_update_seconds` and
`services.settings.main.normandy-recipes-capabilities.last_check` advance —
both are set only after a clean sync (`remote-settings.sys.mjs:476-501`).

No narrower mechanism does better: a bare `app.shield.optoutstudies.enabled`
pref lock misses the CFR locks and the policy-level guarantee (the policy
keeps `isAllowed("Shield")` false even if prefs are tampered with).

- **No enrollment happens without data.** The 2026-09-21 incident was a
  poisoned `services.settings.server` (`data:,#remote-settings-dummy/v1`, a
  Mozilla test fixture from `services/settings/Utils.sys.mjs`) plus a blanked
  `app.normandy.api_url`, which starved ALL Remote Settings syncs (no
  successful client sync since 2026-07-22). With the real server restored,
  recipe delivery resumes and enrollment decisions are driven by actual
  recipes again.
- **Enrollment audit** (2026-09-21): existing enrollments inventoried; the
  no-future-studies posture is enforced by keeping the recipe pipeline
  honest, not by breaking the pipeline.
- If the trace shows `DisableFirefoxStudies` (or a narrower knob) suppresses
  studies while preserving remediation, it will be added here with the exact
  mechanism and source lines cited.

## Remote Settings collections this preserves

Security- and update-relevant collections that keep syncing with the default
server (none are gated by the studies policy):

- `hijack-blocklists`, `cert-revocation` / blocklist family
- `addons-manager-settings`, `addons-data-leak-blocker-domains`
- `search-config-v2`, `doh-config` / `doh-providers`
- `fingerprinting-protection-overrides`, `query-stripping`,
  `anti-tracking-url-decoration`, `cookie-banner-rules-list`
- `password-rules`, `change-password-urls`, `fxmonitor-breaches`
- `nimbus-desktop-experiments`, `nimbus-secure-experiments` (recipe delivery)

## Incident log

- 2026-09-21: `services.settings.server` found set to
  `data:,#remote-settings-dummy/v1` and `app.normandy.api_url` blanked in the
  Nightly profile. Provenance hunt in progress (see fleet). Repaired by
  `firefox-rs-repair.sh v2`: prefs.js cleaned, good values pinned in
  `user.js` (Firefox reads it at every startup, never writes it), policies
  deployed, pacman hook + systemd path unit installed for durability.
