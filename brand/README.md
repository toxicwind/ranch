# Brand - the branding iron for the ranch

Every head of cattle gets branded before it joins the herd. Every commit gets
branded before it joins the repo. One iron, every ranch repo - fast,
high-precision, and allergic to false positives.

gets out of it.*


## Why the old hooks failed (the audit)

**Old pre-commit** (`sovereign/.git/hooks/pre-commit`, disabled 2026-09-30):

| Check | What it did | Why it hurt |
|---|---|---|
| Lockfile gate | Blocked any commit touching `bun.lock`/`package-lock.json` unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` | Legitimate dependency updates got blocked; the bypass env var was obscure and undiscoverable |
| Gitleaks, official 222-rule config | `protect --staged` with the default rule set | Flagged test fixtures (`tc:nodekey:0123456789abcdef…` in `*.test.ts`), base64 image/font blobs in SVGs, and example keys. No test-file exclusions, no placeholder allowlist |
| KB freshness | Delegated to another hook script | Noise — unrelated to commit safety |

**Old push-guard** (`bin/push-guard.sh`, 389 lines):

| Check | Why it hurt |
|---|---|
| Same 222-rule gitleaks scan | Same false positives, now blocking *pushes*. Required a manual per-path ignore-memory workflow (`push-guard.sh ignore …`) — human review for every false positive |
| `git diff --check` | Blocked a real push over a blank line at EOF in a `.svelte` file |
| gofmt + go vet | Slow, Go-specific checks in a push hook that also guards the Svelte UI |

Chris's verdict: *"its causing more trouble than intended right now tbh."*

## Design principles

1. **Never block legitimate work.** Test fixtures, example keys, base64 assets,
   and lockfile updates from real dependency changes must NOT be blocked.
2. **Catch real secrets.** Known key formats (`AKIA…`, `ghp_…`, `sk_live_…`,
   `xoxb-…`), PEM private keys, high-entropy assigned values.
3. **Fast.** <100ms for the pre-commit path. One gitleaks invocation, no Go toolchain.
4. **One source of truth.** This directory. Every repo installs from here.
5. **Sane override.** `git commit --no-verify` / `git push --no-verify` always works.
   `HOOKSMITH_SKIP=1` is the loud alternative (prints an audit line).
6. **Warn vs block.** Definite secrets → block. Odd-but-not-secret (lockfile
   changed without its manifest) → warn and continue.

## What's here

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | The hook. One gitleaks `protect --staged` scan with `gitleaks.toml` (blocks), plus lockfile advisories (warn). Skips gracefully if gitleaks or the config is missing. |
| `pre-push` | Lighter backstop. Gitleaks `detect --log-opts` over each pushed ref range. Catches `--no-verify` commits and rebases. |
| `gitleaks.toml` | Custom high-precision config. 6 rules (key formats + PEM + generic assignment). Global path allowlist: test files, fixtures, `*.example`, generated assets (svg/png/fonts), lockfiles. The generic rule additionally allowlists placeholder values (`example`, `fake`, `changeme`, repeating patterns like `0123456789abcdef`, `xxx…`). Key-format rules are deliberately strict — a committed `AKIA…` or `ghp_…` is always flagged, even with EXAMPLE in it (GitHub's scanner does the same). |
| `install.sh` | Installer. Usage: `install.sh [repo-path]`. Inside sovereign-projects it symlinks (hooks track the checkout); elsewhere it copies a snapshot (re-run to update). Idempotent. |

## What the hooks deliberately do NOT do

- **No lockfile gate.** The old `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE` block is gone. A lockfile
  changing without its manifest prints a one-line note, nothing more.
- **No whitespace gate.** Trailing whitespace / blank-line-at-EOF is an editor
  concern, not a commit blocker.
- **No gofmt / go vet.** Slow, language-specific, and they broke pushes for
  unrelated trees. CI owns formatting.
- **No KB checks.** Unrelated to commit safety.

## Install

```sh
# sovereign-projects (or anywhere, after cloning it):
./tools/git-hooks/install.sh /path/to/repo

# verify:
ls -l /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Repos currently installed: `sovereign-projects`, `ranch`, `herd`.

## Bypass

```sh
git commit --no-verify   # always works, no questions asked
git push --no-verify     # same for pushes
HOOKSMITH_SKIP=1 git commit   # loud alternative: prints an audit line
```

If a *test fixture* trips the scanner, the right fix is to move it into a
`*test*` file or `fixtures/` directory (both excluded) — not to bypass.

## Tuning

- `HOOKSMITH_CONFIG=/path/to/gitleaks.toml` — override the config.
- `GITLEAKS_BIN=/path/to/gitleaks` — override the binary.
- `HOOKSMITH_TIME=1` — print hook timing to stderr.

To add a rule or allowlist entry, edit `gitleaks.toml` here and re-run
`install.sh` in the snapshot repos (ranch, herd). Symlinked repos
(sovereign-projects) pick it up immediately.

## Build

`scripts/flicker-build.sh` is the main build entry. It submits the hook checks
to flicker (the estate build daemon, http://127.0.0.1:25148): shell syntax
check on all three scripts plus a behavioral smoke test — a real-shaped
secret commit is BLOCKED and a clean commit passes.

```sh
./scripts/flicker-build.sh
```
