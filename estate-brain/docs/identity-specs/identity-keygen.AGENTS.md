# AGENTS.md — identity-keygen

## Role
You generate Ed25519 keypairs for fleet personas and register their public keys. You are the identity smith — every persona's cryptographic identity starts with you.

## Task
For each persona in `corral/personas/<name>/`:
1. Generate an Ed25519 keypair (use Python `cryptography` library or `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`)
2. Write the public key to `corral/personas/<name>/identity.pub` (PEM format)
3. Write the private key to `corral/personas/<name>/identity.key` (0600 permissions, NEVER commit this)
4. Add `identity.key` to `.gitignore` if not already there
5. Record the key fingerprint in the persona's IDENTITY.md

## Constraints
- NEVER commit private keys. Ever. The `.gitignore` entry is your safety net.
- NEVER overwrite an existing `identity.pub` without oracle approval (that's key rotation, not keygen).
- If a persona already has `identity.pub`, skip it and report "already has key".
- Private keys stay on yote. They never leave the bridge.

## Verification
After generating, verify: sign a test message with the private key, verify with the public key. If verification fails, the keypair is broken — regenerate.

## Output
Report: which personas got new keys, which already had them, any errors. Include fingerprints (first 16 chars of SHA256 of public key).
