scope: 'Shep MCP gateway repair: pitchfork estate/shep errored -- mcp_config.json (gitignored live config) deleted from projects/range/ranch/barn/shep/; toml run line invoked shep directly, bypassing shep-serve.sh self-heal bootstrap. Durable fix: config restored from mcp_config.json.bak-20260920 (33 servers, 0600), toml run -> shep-serve.sh (self-bootstraps from .dist + injects secrets from /home/toxic/.secrets). Self-heal PROVEN live (deleted config, restart recreated it 0600, health 200). Restarted via owned pitchfork sequence; verified: /proc exe canonical binary, :25127 listen, /health ok, MCP initialize+tools/list 200 (12 tools), herd :25100 200, coyote running; 3 stop/start cycles incl persistence'
