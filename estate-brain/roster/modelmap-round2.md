scope: 'Model-stack round 2 (the Architect: "Fix all three of those maximally"): (1) oracle-judge-local re-entrant shim deadlock -- shim hosted INSIDE herd forwarded to beellama/gemma-96k, another cmd model; swapper could not swap while shim held the slot (health 200, completions hung 8s -> 502). Fixed as native herd alias; alias-shim v3.1 hardened (split connect/read timeouts, loud 502s, no-shim-targeting-cmd-models rule). (2) small/medium/code/long: round-1 ''undefined vars'' diagnosis was WRONG -- macros defined, gguf on disk, routes 200; real fault was aliases were worktree-only WIP wiped by an unrelated 06:26 MDT config rewrite -> now committed; dead beellama-fast dup removed. (3) Kimi exhaustion: NO free Kimi completes -- OpenRouter removed :free Kimi IDs (404), HF monthly credits depleted (402), Moonshot 429 billing-suspended (key valid), NIM 410 gone, Pollinations 404, no local weights (1T MoE cannot fit 24GB); kimi/kimi-k2/kimi-code/kimi-auto fail loudly with genuine upstream status; kimi-auto-shim :25153 TOML-vs-snapshot drift reconciled to the free-Kimi chain. MOONSHOT STOOD DOWN 2026-09-21 (eclipse, the Architect: no top-up, ever): chat completions -> exceeded_current_quota_error (suspended, insufficient balance; key itself valid, /v1/models 200). Peer parked in herd.yaml; kimi route names re-pointed at the free-Kimi chain.'
