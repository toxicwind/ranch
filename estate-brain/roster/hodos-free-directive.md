scope: 'Hodos :25193 literal "free" routing directive repair: was 404 (serves_model filtered before Strategy::Free ran), then Hybrid admitted paid providers, then migrate_v1 dropped free_tier so Strategy::Free selected zero candidates (502). Fix: "free" skips model scoping + forces Strategy::Free + model_map["free"] resolves a real upstream model (never wildcard "*"); migrate_v1 keeps free_tier=true; provider IDs refreshed to live catalog (nvidia nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b, llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct; groq/cerebras bare IDs). hodos-run.sh wrapper loads GROQ/CEREBRAS/NVIDIA keys from ~/.secrets into the daemon env (pitchfork.toml run= now points at the wrapper). NIM_PROXY_BYPASS workaround removed from bidder.py.'
