# fleet-watchdog cell-side driver.
# Durable copy: /home/toxic/estate/tools/fleet-ops/fleet-watchdog/driver.sh
# The platform scheduler runs THIS (bash ~/workspace/fleet-watchdog/driver.sh).
#
# The hot sweep path is DIRECT on awrawr-pc: sweepd.sh loops sweep.py every
# 60s with no agent-wrapper dispatch and no bridge hop (presence TTL 120s,
# so 60s keeps the lane-7 heartbeat alive with 60s margin). This driver is
# the 2m supervisor/backstop entrypoint. Three steps:
#   1. sync the rollover mirror cell -> awrawr-pc (best effort; sweep still
#      runs on the last good mirror if this fails)
#   2. sync the io-governor pages file (best effort; skipped if absent)
#   3. run the awrawr-pc supervisor: ensures sweepd is alive (restarts it if
#      dead/wedged) and runs ONE backstop sweep only when the last sweep is
#      stale. Prints one JSON line.
#
# Receipt design (2026-09-19, lane-6): cron workers intermittently end runs
# with a null result_summary even on success, so the driver emits its own
# WATCH-OK + HONEST-RECEIPT footer. The job body instructs the worker to
# copy the last two stdout lines verbatim as the run's final message.
