// triggers.ts — the single merged trigger-shape database for the

// shapes observed 2026-09-30: refused replies/spawns, retired tmp-janitor,
// refused restarter phrasings, quarantined cross-chat nudges) with the
// classifier-sweep shapes (directive markers, goal-guide process language).
//
// Each shape carries the regex, WHY it flags, and the behavioral REWRITE.
// False-positive repair for our own operational docs only — never evasion of
// a correct flag. If a flag lands on a task whose actual purpose is wrong,
// the flag was right and the task dies.
