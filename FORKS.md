# ranch/FORKS.md

Every `ranch/*` directory is a vendored fork, indexed here with its upstream and
`toxicwind/*` counterpart. Pinned SHAs capture the exact tip; bump intentionally
and re-record.

## Naming policy

- **Dodge-name landmines**: avoid names that collide with upstream product names.
  The "hatch" dodge was retired 2026-10-15 because Meta's VM gateway is
  literally named `hatch.metaaivm.com` (see `~/kite/docs-meta-muse-hatch.md`).
  Our cell is **kite** (real) / hatch (dodge); agents are **eyas**.
- **Submodule structure** is the target end-state for every fork (per
  standing doctrine); vendored-in-tree (qed/zed pattern) is the current
  intermediate. The `ranch/` gitignore line 1210 keeps ranch as its own
  subrepo boundary; submodules would live *under* ranch/ as separate git
  trees with their own .git.

## Bump procedure

1. Update the SHA in this table.
2. `git pull --rebase origin main` in the affected dir.
3. Bump the KILO_VERSION file (or equivalent) in the fork.
4. Push the fork's `main` to `toxicwind/<name>`.
5. Commit the FORKS.md change to `ranch` and push.
