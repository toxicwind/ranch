# Complete install + sovereign Firefox live control wiring for github-advanced-search-mcp
# Run this after cloning (or as part of "youaretoinstallthatgithubcompletelyplease")
# It ensures:
# - All JS/TS deps (bun)
# - Python deps (uv)
# - Playwright browsers (firefox + chromium for the browser control story)
# - The sovereign-browser/ launchers are present and executable (the Firefox "cdp-like" integration)
# - Dev tools are ready
# - Optional: registers the MCP in your main Grok TUI config
