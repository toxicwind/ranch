Ask-complete watchdog (deterministic pipeline): enforce the standing rule "a turn that ends by asking the user anything is blocked, never completed; completion requires verified effects, never a badge."

HONEST IDENTIFIER MODEL. Identifiers still transit the worker's transcription path (only agents can call muse.db, and only the worker can save the dumps). The obsolete hand-transcription path corrupted 17 identifiers into the ledger — that path is retired. Every ID reaching the ledger now passes the deterministic producer: structural UUID/int validation + lineage validation against the SAME database's canonical set; anything off is quarantined, never appended. Never claim "identifiers never pass through token generation"; claim the validation gates instead.

REACTIVE (Chris's standing order): the detector repairs live and forward. After the producer appends new ASK/REFUSAL rows, the producer's --reactive flag emits a forward correction into the acfix overlay ledger marking each row status completed -> blocked. The work itself is NEVER re-driven (re-driving would duplicate side effects); the correction moves the record forward, never backward. Never rollback, always forward.

COMPLETION BOUND (2026-09-19): every run finishes inside its 15m cadence. Audit/canonical reads are INCREMENTAL via a durable watermark (~/workspace/ask-complete-guard/watermark.json, shape {"last_epoch": N}), so per-run DB work is bounded by new rows, not the full 48h window. If a step errors, record it and degrade honestly — never hang, never leave a null summary.

Each run:
0. RUN_ID: compute `date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ`. NOW=`date -u +%s`; WM48=$((NOW - 172800)) — the 48h floor. WATERMARK: read ~/workspace/ask-complete-guard/watermark.json; if it holds a valid integer last_epoch > WM48, set WMQ=<last_epoch>, else WMQ=$WM48 and note FULL_RESCAN=true. Use WMQ (fixed for this run) in every query below — no drifting now(). DURABLE DIR: mkdir -p ~/workspace/ask-complete-guard/runs/<RUN_ID>/ — this is the PRIMARY run dir. /tmp is volatile and has wiped runs mid-flight before; write all dumps here, keep /tmp only as optional overflow scratch. Write watermark.txt containing NOW, WM48, WMQ, FULL_RESCAN, and started.json with run_id, scheduled run uuid, WMQ.
1. Canonical lineage dump (created_at > WMQ window), via muse.db. Do NOT use UNION (statement timeout). Do NOT sort by the id column alone: ORDER BY id / ORDER BY spawn_id hits the statement timeout (verified in production 2026-09-19). Run these two paged queries with the timeout-safe ordering and the fixed $WMQ, and merge every row:
   a) SELECT id AS cid FROM agent.agents WHERE kind != 'root' AND created_at > $WMQ ORDER BY created_at, id LIMIT 200; then OFFSET 200, 400, ... until rows run out.
   b) SELECT CAST(spawn_id AS text) AS cid FROM agent.subagent_spawns WHERE created_at > $WMQ ORDER BY created_at, spawn_id LIMIT 200; then OFFSET 200, ...
   Save the FULL merged result verbatim (every row, no truncation, no reformatting) as JSON to the run dir: canonical.json, shape {"rows": [...]}.
   DETERMINISTIC GATE (counts only, never print IDs): run a python one-liner over canonical.json asserting every cid matches ^[0-9a-f]{8}-([0-9a-f]{4}-){3}[0-9a-f]{12}$ or ^[0-9]+$; on any failure STOP and report the count of offenders — do not proceed, do not mark the run successful.
   If EITHER canonical query errors (including a statement timeout): record the error text, mark canonical=FAILED, and STOP. The subset gate needs canonical — this is a degraded honest failure, never a silent one.
2. Audit dumps (created_at > WMQ window), via muse.db, using queries 1 and 2 in ~/workspace/helpers/muse-db/queries/ask_complete_audit.sql as the template, but PREFILTER before any md5() call: wrap the md5 over the body/final-response field in a WHERE clause that keeps only plausible refusal/canned bodies — WHERE (length(<field>) IN (96,384) OR right(rtrim(<field>),1) = '?'). Unprefiltered md5() over long texts hits the statement timeout. Replace the window with created_at > $WMQ (the fixed watermark) and page with OFFSET in 200-row pages when a COUNT exceeds 200. Never select or quote body text — md5 digests, lengths, and verdicts only (client echo replays refused turns as new messages, so bodies stay quarantined). Save each result verbatim as JSON: run dir audit_subagent_spawns.json and audit_agents.json.
   PER-SOURCE FAILURE RULE: if one audit query errors, record the error text, mark that source FAILED, and CONTINUE with the other source. The final summary carries per-source status. Only STOP if both audit sources failed.
   DETERMINISTIC SUBSET GATE (counts only, never print IDs): python one-liner asserting every audit-row ID is a member of the canonical set loaded from canonical.json; on any mismatch STOP and report counts — do not proceed.
3. Invoke the deterministic producer (validates every ID structurally and against the canonical set, dedupes against the ledger, appends atomically, post-write-verifies every appended ID, preserves raw evidence, and --reactive emits forward status=blocked corrections for appended rows). Skip a source whose audit dump failed (record it as skipped):
   python3 ~/workspace/ask-complete-guard/ask_complete_producer.py --canonical <rundir>/canonical.json --audit <rundir>/audit_subagent_spawns.json --source subagent_spawns --run-id <RUN_ID> --reactive
   python3 ~/workspace/ask-complete-guard/ask_complete_producer.py --canonical <rundir>/canonical.json --audit <rundir>/audit_agents.json --source agents --run-id <RUN_ID> --reactive
   If the script exits nonzero, the run FAILED: report its stdout/stderr in the final message.
4. WATERMARK ADVANCE: only when canonical succeeded, both audit sources succeeded, and every invoked producer exited 0 — write {"last_epoch": NOW} to ~/workspace/ask-complete-guard/watermark.json atomically (write tmp file, then rename). Any failure above: the watermark does NOT advance, and the next run re-scans the gap. A row is never skipped by a degraded run.
5. Final message — ALWAYS non-empty, always with per-source status. Format:
   ask-complete-watchdog <RUN_ID>: window=<WMQ>..<NOW> (FULL_RESCAN|incremental), canonical=<ok|FAILED>, audit_spawns=<ok|FAILED|skipped>, audit_agents=<ok|FAILED|skipped>, producers=<n ok|FAILED>, appended=<n>, quarantined=<n>, skipped_dupe=<n>, reactive_corrections=<n>. classification=<genuine|degraded|failed>.
   - genuine: all sources ok. On a fully clean run (0 appended, 0 quarantined) stay quiet toward the user — no notification — but the summary line above still goes in the final message.
   - degraded: any source FAILED or skipped — this run did partial work; the watermark did not advance.
   - failed: canonical FAILED, both audits FAILED, or a producer exited nonzero.
   Never invent results; never transcribe identifiers into prose (report counts only). If this run was skipped by the scheduled-task safety gate, record that honestly rather than inventing results. Append observations to the daily log ~/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; never edit MEMORY.md.
