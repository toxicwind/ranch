# 🤠 ranch

One of the estate's five pens (`pens/{estate,geode,barn,ranch,olympus}`).
Every pen has the same shape: `products/` for peer standalone checkouts,
`docs/` for pen-owned documentation, and a `bin/` entrypoint surface that
is symlinked into `~/.local/bin` and pinned by the estate-ops manifest.

## Products

| Product | Port | Language | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Layout
```text
ranch/
  .gitignore    kitchen-sink `*` + whitelist (submoduleless doctrine)
  README.md     this file — role, member table, ports, languages
  LICENSE
  package.json
  mise.toml
  AGENTS.md
  bin/          entrypoint symlink surface -> ~/.local/bin
  products/     peer standalone checkouts (auto-ignored, never tracked)
  docs/         pen-owned documentation
```

## Tooling

- **bin surface**: entrypoints symlinked into `~/.local/bin`, pinned by the
-  estate-ops manifest and verified by `bin-verify.sh`. A broken link is
-  a FAIL, never a WARN.
-  **README**: generated from the pen's own product set by
-  `bin/readme-gen.ts`.

## Conventions

- Submoduleless: peer repos are shallow clones, never git submodules
- Ports SSOT: `config/ports.env` is the single source of truth for :25xxx ports
- Bun runtime: all TS/JS products run on Bun; Go and Rust are compiled binaries
