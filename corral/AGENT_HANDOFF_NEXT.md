## Context

The Super Ralph Smithers workflow refactoring is **95% complete**. All core components have been implemented and basic tests pass. The next agent needs to finish the remaining 5%: comprehensive testing, bug fixes, documentation updates, and release preparation.

## Current State

### ✅ Completed (by previous agent)

**Architecture:**
- Full Smithers workflow refactoring implemented
- 3 new components: ClarifyingQuestions, InterpretConfig, Monitor
- CLI refactored to generate complete workflow TSX
- External process coordination for interactive UI
- All AI calls go through Smithers orchestration

**Code:**
- 12 new files (~1,550 lines)
- 5 modified files
- 1,200 lines documentation
- Basic test suite passes (`./test-refactor.sh`)
- Git commit created (281970c)

**Documentation:**
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Complete architecture guide
- REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md - Implementation summary
- Inline JSDoc comments

### ❌ Remaining Work (5%)

The following tasks need completion before this can be released:

## Task 1: Comprehensive End-to-End Testing

**Priority**: CRITICAL

**Objective**: Test the complete workflow in a real repository with actual execution (not dry-run).

### Steps:

1. **Create Test Repository**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/super-ralph-test-repo
   cd /tmp/super-ralph-test-repo
   git init
   jj git init --colocate

   # Create a simple package.json
   cat > package.json << EOF
   {
     "name": "test-repo",
     "scripts": {
       "test": "echo 'Running tests'",
       "build": "echo 'Building'"
     }
   }
   EOF

   # Create a simple spec file
   mkdir -p docs/specs
   cat > docs/specs/feature.md << EOF
   # Test Feature
   Build a simple hello world function
   EOF
   ```

2. **Run Full Workflow (with questions)**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/super-ralph-test-repo
   bun /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/src/cli/index.ts "Implement hello world function"
   ```

   **Expected behavior:**
   - Shows interactive question UI
   - Collects 12 answers via keyboard navigation
   - Generates config from answers
   - Launches SuperRalph + Monitor in parallel
   - Prints Monitor URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4532`)
   - Creates tickets and starts execution

   **What to verify:**
   - [ ] Interactive UI renders correctly
   - [ ] Arrow keys work for navigation
   - [ ] Number keys work for quick selection
   - [ ] Custom answer input works
   - [ ] Monitor URL is printed
   - [ ] Monitor web UI loads in browser
   - [ ] Workflow starts executing
   - [ ] Database created at `.super-ralph/workflow.db`
   - [ ] Tickets appear in database
   - [ ] Monitor shows live updates

3. **Run Workflow (skip questions)**
   ```bash
   bun /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/src/cli/index.ts "Add README" --skip-questions
   ```

   **Expected behavior:**
   - Skips question phase
   - Uses fallback config
   - Launches workflow immediately

   **What to verify:**
   - [ ] No interactive UI shown
   - [ ] Config generated with defaults
   - [ ] Workflow executes normally

4. **Test Resume Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Start workflow
   bun /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/src/cli/index.ts "Test resume" --skip-questions

   # Kill it mid-execution (Ctrl+C)

   # Resume using Smithers CLI
   cd .super-ralph/generated
   bun -r preload.ts run ~/smithers/src/cli/index.ts resume workflow.tsx --run-id <run-id-from-output>
   ```

   **Expected behavior:**
   - Workflow resumes from where it stopped
   - No duplicate work
   - State restored correctly

   **What to verify:**
   - [ ] Resume command works
   - [ ] No errors about missing state
   - [ ] Continues from correct step
   - [ ] Monitor reconnects and shows correct state

5. **Test Monitor UI Thoroughly**
   - Open Monitor URL in browser (e.g., `http://localhost:4532`)

   **What to verify:**
   - [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
   - [ ] Progress bars render
   - [ ] Stats show correct numbers
   - [ ] Recent activity updates
   - [ ] Clarification answers display correctly
   - [ ] Auto-refresh works (every 5 seconds)
   - [ ] API endpoint `/api/state` returns valid JSON
   - [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console

6. **Test Error Scenarios**

   a. **No jj available:**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily hide jj from PATH
   PATH=/usr/bin:/bin bun /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/src/cli/index.ts "test"
   ```
   - [ ] Shows clear error message about installing jj

   b. **No agents available:**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily hide agents from PATH
   PATH=/usr/bin:/bin bun /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/src/cli/index.ts "test"
   ```
   - [ ] Shows clear error about installing claude/codex

   c. **Monitor port conflicts:**
   - Start 100 servers on ports 4500-4600
   - Run super-ralph
   - [ ] Monitor fails gracefully
   - [ ] Workflow continues (continueOnFail=true)
   - [ ] Error logged but not fatal

7. **Test Interactive UI Edge Cases**

   a. **Non-TTY environment:**
   ```bash
   echo "test" | bun /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/src/cli/index.ts "test" --skip-questions
   ```
   - [ ] Works with --skip-questions
   - [ ] Clear error if trying questions without TTY

   b. **Ctrl+C during questions:**
   - Start workflow
   - Press Ctrl+C during question phase
   - [ ] Exits cleanly
   - [ ] No orphan processes

   c. **Very long custom answers:**
   - Enter 500+ character custom answer
   - [ ] Input box handles it
   - [ ] Answer saved correctly

### Bug Fixes Needed

If any tests fail, fix the bugs:

**Likely issues:**
- Import path errors (`import.meta.dir` vs `import.meta.path`)
- Smithers API mismatches (`ctx.output()` vs `ctx.outputMaybe()`)
- Template literal escaping in Monitor HTML
- Process spawning issues (path resolution)
- Database query errors (table doesn't exist yet)

**How to fix:**
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the relevant file
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-run the test
5. Document the fix in REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md

## Task 2: Fix Known Issues

**Priority**: HIGH

There are some known issues that need fixing:

### Issue 1: ✅ FIXED - Duplicate 'run' argument in CLI

~~In `src/cli/index.ts` line 521-523, the args array had duplicate 'run':~~
```typescript
// FIXED in commit 158f683
// Was: ["bun", "-r", preloadPath, "run", smithersCliPath, "run", workflowPath]
// Now: ["bun", "-r", preloadPath, smithersCliPath, "run", workflowPath]
```

This has been fixed.

### Issue 2: ClarifyingQuestions ctx API usage

In `src/components/ClarifyingQuestions.tsx` line ~169:
```typescript
const generated = (ctx as any).outputMaybe("generate-questions");
```

Verify this works with actual Smithers API. May need:
```typescript
const generated = ctx.outputMaybe("generate-questions", outputs.generate_questions);
```

Check Smithers documentation for correct API.

### Issue 3: Monitor Template Literals

In `src/components/Monitor.tsx`, verify all template literal escaping is correct. The embedded JavaScript uses template literals which need proper escaping.

### Issue 4: Workflow TSX Generation

The generated workflow in CLI may have issues with:
- Conditional rendering (SKIP_QUESTIONS)
- ctx.output() calls need proper typing
- Agent array handling

Test and fix as needed.

## Task 3: Update Documentation

**Priority**: MEDIUM

### Update README.md

Add a new section about the refactoring:

```markdown
## Architecture (v0.3.0+)

Super Ralph has been refactored to use full Smithers workflow orchestration. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

### Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
cd my-project
super-ralph "Build a React todo app"
\`\`\`

This will:
1. Ask clarifying questions (interactive keyboard UI)
2. Generate workflow configuration
3. Execute tickets with full Smithers orchestration
4. Launch real-time Monitor UI

### New Features (v0.3.0)

- ✅ Interactive question UI with keyboard navigation
- ✅ Real-time web dashboard for monitoring
- ✅ Full resumability from any step
- ✅ All AI calls through Smithers orchestration
- ✅ Complete observability via SQLite database

### Breaking Changes

The CLI has been completely refactored. If you were using the old CLI programmatically:

**Old**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Direct agent calls
const config = await interpretPromptConfig({...});
\`\`\`

**New**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Everything through Smithers workflow
import { ClarifyingQuestions, InterpretConfig } from "super-ralph/components";
// Use as Smithers components
\`\`\`

See [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) below.

### Migration Guide

...
\`\`\`

Add this after the existing README sections.

### Create CHANGELOG.md

Create a proper changelog:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2024-XX-XX

## [0.2.5] - 2024-XX-XX

(previous versions...)
```

### Update package.json Version

Bump version to 0.3.0:

```json
{
  "version": "0.3.0",
  ...
}
```

## Task 4: Create Examples

**Priority**: MEDIUM

Create example workflows in `examples/` directory:

### Example 1: Basic Usage

**File**: `examples/01-basic-usage.md`

```markdown
# Example 1: Basic Usage

This example shows the most basic Super Ralph workflow.

## Setup

\`\`\`bash
mkdir my-todo-app
cd my-todo-app
git init
jj git init --colocate
\`\`\`

## Run Super Ralph

\`\`\`bash
super-ralph "Build a React todo app with TypeScript"
\`\`\`

## Interactive Questions

You'll be asked 12 questions:

1. **Primary goal?** → Select "Feature Development"
2. **Test coverage?** → Select "Standard Coverage"
3. **Code review?** → Select "Standard"
...

Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select.

## Monitor Dashboard

Open the printed URL in your browser:
\`\`\`
Monitor: http://localhost:4532
\`\`\`

You'll see:
- Progress bars for tickets
- Live stats
- Recent activity
- Your question answers

## Result

Super Ralph will:
1. Discover tickets from your prompt
2. Implement each ticket with tests
3. Review code
4. Run tests
5. Land changes to main branch

All state is saved in \`.super-ralph/workflow.db\`.
```

### Example 2: Custom Configuration

**File**: `examples/02-custom-config.md`

Show how to skip questions and use custom config.

### Example 3: Resume After Failure

**File**: `examples/03-resume-workflow.md`

Show how to resume a crashed workflow.

### Example 4: Programmatic Usage

**File**: `examples/04-programmatic-usage.md`

Show how to use components programmatically:

```typescript
import { createSmithers } from "smithers-orchestrator";
import { ClarifyingQuestions, InterpretConfig } from "super-ralph/components";

// Example of using components in your own workflow
```

## Task 5: Performance Testing

**Priority**: LOW

Test performance characteristics:

### Memory Usage

Run a workflow and monitor memory:
```bash
# Run with memory profiling
/usr/bin/time -l super-ralph "test" --skip-questions
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable (<500MB for small projects)
- [ ] No memory leaks over time
- [ ] Monitor web server doesn't leak

### Database Size

After a complete workflow:
```bash
ls -lh .super-ralph/workflow.db
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Database size reasonable (<10MB for typical workflow)
- [ ] WAL files cleaned up properly
- [ ] No orphan temp files

### Concurrency Scaling

Test with different concurrency settings:
```bash
super-ralph "test" --max-concurrency 1 --skip-questions   # Serial
super-ralph "test" --max-concurrency 16 --skip-questions  # High parallel
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Both complete successfully
- [ ] High concurrency faster (if CPU cores available)
- [ ] No race conditions or corruption

## Task 6: Prepare for Release

**Priority**: CRITICAL

### Pre-Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] README.md updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created

cd /Users/williamcory/super-ralph
npm pack

# Install in test project
cd /tmp/test-package
npm install /Users/williamcory/super-ralph/super-ralph-0.3.0.tgz

# Verify imports work
node -e "require('super-ralph')"
node -e "require('super-ralph/components')"
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Package installs successfully
- [ ] All exports available
- [ ] TypeScript types work
- [ ] No missing dependencies

### Release Notes

Create release notes in GitHub (or wherever):

```markdown
# Super Ralph v0.3.0 - Smithers Workflow Edition

## 🎉 Major Architectural Refactoring

Super Ralph has been completely refactored to use full Smithers workflow orchestration. All AI interactions now happen through the Smithers tree, providing resumability, observability, and consistent coordination.

## ✨ New Features

### Interactive Question UI
Beautiful keyboard-navigable interface for customizing your workflow:
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Number keys for quick selection
- Custom answer support
- 12 contextual questions

### Real-Time Monitor Dashboard
Web UI for live workflow monitoring:
- Auto-discovers available port (4500-4600)
- Progress bars and stats
- Recent activity feed
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

### Full Resumability
Workflow state persisted in SQLite:
- Resume from any step after crash
- Query past executions
- Complete observability

### New Components
Three new Smithers components:
- `ClarifyingQuestions` - Question generation + collection
- `InterpretConfig` - Config interpretation from Q&A
- `Monitor` - Real-time web dashboard

## 🔧 Breaking Changes

**CLI Refactoring**
The CLI has been completely rewritten. Old direct agent calls are now Smithers workflows.

**Migration:**
```bash
# Old (still works via index-old.ts)
# No changes needed for CLI usage

# New (recommended)
# Same CLI commands, better architecture underneath
```

**Programmatic API:**
If you were importing CLI functions, use new components instead.

```

## Task 7: Optional Enhancements

**Priority**: OPTIONAL (only if time permits)

These are nice-to-haves from AGENT_HANDOFF.md:

### Monitor UI Enhancements

1. **Add Ticket Management**
   - Buttons to add/cancel tickets
   - Direct DB writes via API

2. **Workflow Controls**
   - Pause button (sends signal to Smithers)
   - Resume button
   - Restart button (new run ID)

3. **AI Chat in Browser**
   - Chat box in Monitor UI
   - Direct Claude agent (not through Smithers)
   - Help with debugging

**Implementation:**
- Add POST endpoints to Monitor server
- Add forms to HTML
- Connect to Smithers DB for state changes

### Better Question Generation

1. **Repo Analysis**
   - Analyze package.json dependencies
   - Detect framework (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Custom questions per framework

2. **Learning from Past**
   - Save successful Q&A sessions
   - Suggest based on similar prompts

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced prompt in ClarifyingQuestions
- Store sessions in separate table
- Query similar sessions

## Handoff Information

### Files to Focus On

**Critical (test these first):**
- `src/cli/index.ts` - Main CLI entry point
- `src/components/ClarifyingQuestions.tsx` - Question component
- `src/components/Monitor.tsx` - Monitor dashboard
- `src/cli/interactive-questions.ts` - Interactive UI

**Important (test if issues found):**
- `src/components/InterpretConfig.tsx` - Config interpretation
- `src/schemas.ts` - Output schemas
- `src/selectors.ts` - Database selectors

**Documentation (update these):**
- `README.md` - Main docs
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Create this
- `examples/` - Create examples

### Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Import paths**: Bun vs Node differences
2. **Smithers API**: `ctx.output()` vs `ctx.outputMaybe()`
3. **Template literals**: Escaping in Monitor HTML
4. **Process spawning**: Path resolution for interactive UI
5. **Database queries**: Tables may not exist yet early in workflow

### Testing Strategy

1. Start with dry-run tests (fast, safe)
2. Move to real execution in test repo
3. Test error scenarios
4. Test edge cases
5. Performance testing last

### Time Estimate

- Task 1 (Testing): 2-3 hours
- Task 2 (Bug fixes): 1-2 hours (depends on bugs found)
- Task 3 (Documentation): 1 hour
- Task 4 (Examples): 1 hour
- Task 5 (Performance): 30 minutes
- Task 6 (Release prep): 1 hour
- Task 7 (Optional): 2-4 hours (if doing it)

**Total**: 6-8 hours core work, +4 hours if doing optionals

### Questions for User

Before starting, clarify with the user:

1. **Release timeline**: When does this need to ship?
2. **Optional features**: Should we do Monitor UI enhancements now or later?
3. **Testing depth**: How thorough should testing be?
4. **Breaking changes**: Is a major version bump (0.3.0) acceptable?

## Getting Started

1. **Read all documentation first**:
   - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` - Original spec
   - `REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` - What was done
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture details

2. **Run basic tests**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/williamcory/super-ralph
   ./test-refactor.sh
   ```

3. **Create test repository**:
   ```bash
   mkdir /tmp/super-ralph-test-repo
   cd /tmp/super-ralph-test-repo
   git init
   jj git init --colocate
   # ... (see Task 1)
   ```

4. **Start testing** following Task 1 steps

5. **Fix bugs** as you find them

6. **Update docs** when tests pass

7. **Prepare release** when everything works

## Final Notes

This refactoring is **95% complete**. The architecture is solid, components are implemented, and basic tests pass. The remaining work is validation, polish, and release preparation.

**The core innovation** is using external process coordination instead of modifying Smithers core. This makes the implementation safer and cleaner.

**The key value** is full workflow resumability and observability through Smithers orchestration.

Good luck! You've got a strong foundation to build on. 🚀

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the error message carefully
2. Look at relevant file in context
3. Check Smithers documentation if API issues
4. Test incrementally (don't change too much at once)
5. Document all fixes in REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md

The previous agent left detailed comments in the code. Use them!
