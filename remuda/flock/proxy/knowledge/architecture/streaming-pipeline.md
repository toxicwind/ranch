# Streaming pipeline — `src/proxy.rs`

For a `stream: true` chat request:

1. **Auth + parse** once: client name, model label, stream flag, affinity
   hash, and (unless `strict_passthrough` is set in Settings)
   [usage injection](../decisions/usage-injection-auto-fallback.md) with the
   untouched body kept for fallback.
2. **Commit** to `200 text/event-stream` immediately; a spawned task owns the
   rest, feeding an mpsc channel the response body streams from.
3. **Wait loop**: queue via the [dispatcher](dispatcher.md); every heartbeat
   interval a `: heartbeat` comment goes out (send failure = client gone →
   the granted slot is never wasted on a dead request).
4. **Send + triage**: 400-after-injection → retry untouched and remember the
   model; 429/500/502/503/504 → cool down the lane, `: retrying` comment, loop
   (instant failover to other lanes); other non-2xx → relay as an in-stream
   `error` event; success → pipe.
5. **Race the absolute deadline**: when the caller supplies
   `X-Nim-Proxy-Deadline-Ms`, the spawned workflow races one absolute timer
   that never resets on heartbeats, retries, or data. Expiry drops the whole
   workflow (reqwest work + model/queue ownership), records status `deadline`,
   and best-effort sends a terminal `deadline_exceeded` SSE error. See the
   [deadline decision](../decisions/explicit-request-deadline.md).
6. **Pipe with watchdog**: chunks forward verbatim while the private
   [`SseObserver`](nim-observations.md) assembles only one bounded current SSE
   event for side-band classification. Each upstream read races two exits in a `select!`: the
   `stream_idle` timeout cuts stalled upstreams with an in-stream error
   (status label `stall`), and `tx.closed()` notices a client hang-up
   immediately — freeing the request's `max_inflight` slot at disconnect
   time rather than at the stall cutoff (with `stream_idle` 0 there is no
   cutoff, so this is what prevents hung upstreams from pinning slots until
   restart).
7. **Account**: TTFT histogram at first chunk; one owner finalizes the bounded
   observer at every terminal stream exit. A deadline preserves usage already
   observed before expiry without estimating the partial stream; disconnected
   and truncated streams remain unavailable. Finalized measured prompt,
   measured/estimated completion (`source="usage"`/`"estimate"`), bounded
   finish, reasoning, and tool counters are recorded once; one access-log line
   is emitted per request. Invalid/unavailable upstream observation values emit
   no existing numeric metric.

Non-streaming requests use the same wait/retry loop minus heartbeats and pass
the already-buffered JSON body to the same observation rules. An explicit deadline races the whole
buffered future, which is also how the proxy bounds upstream work after an
otherwise-unobservable buffered client disconnect. `/v1/models` GETs
short-circuit to a TTL cache with single-flight refresh.
