# Zed

**The high-performance, multiplayer code editor** — from the creators of [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) and [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). GPU-rendered, Rust-native, and built for the age of AI agents.

## 🔱 toxicwind/zed — this fork

*Last synced with upstream: **Jul 20, 2026** — [diff](https://github.com/toxicwind/zed/compare/main...zed-industries:zed:main)*

This is a **thin fork** of [zed-industries/zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) with patches focused on agent reliability, code search, and build toolchain. Every patch is meant for upstream — they just haven't gotten there yet.

### Why should I care?

- **Agent reliability patches** — NVIDIA NIM direct provider, MCP-proxy-hardened OpenAI-compatible providers, tool-schema normalizers that break the infinite retry loop on 120+ tool sets
- **Search that survives the estate** — grep respects `.ignore` (no more OOM on multi-GB trajectory dirs), ast-grep dev helpers
- **Fast rebuilds** — sccache + mold by default

### What's different

Patches are grouped by surface area. Every patch is upstream-bound — they just haven't landed in `zed-industries/zed` yet.

#### 🤖 Agent — language model providers

| Provider | Wire format | Why it exists |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **`nvidia`** | Full JSON Schema · `interleaved_reasoning` (msg-level `reasoning_content` round-trip) · no `prompt_cache_key` | First-class NVIDIA NIM (Inkling) route. The generic `openai_compatible` path sends `JsonSchemaSubset`, which collapses `type:["string","null"]` / `oneOf` and makes vLLM/Outlines **500** ("Could not translate instance to regex") on large MCP tool sets → Zed retries forever. `interleaved_reasoning` here populates the Assistant message's `reasoning_content` field (proven accepted by Inkling), so prior thinking survives multi-turn — it is NOT a top-level request param. |
| **`openai-mcpproxy`** | Full JSON Schema · `interleaved_reasoning` · self-healing mapper | OpenAI-compatible endpoint fronted by an mcpproxy compact router. Same hardening as `nvidia` + recovers malformed tool-call args as `{}` instead of looping. |
| **`openai-mcpproxy-nvidia`** | Full JSON Schema · `interleaved_reasoning` · NVIDIA identity | Inkling reached through a third-party OpenAI-compatible gateway (e.g. OpenRouter→Inkling). Avoids the same subset-500 loop on non-NVIDIA routes. |

All three share a **non-destructive tool-schema normalizer** (repairs missing root `type`, untyped properties, bare `null` in multi-type arrays — no tool-count cap, no description truncation) and a **self-healing event mapper** that turns a malformed tool-call parse error into a valid `ToolUse` with `{}` input. This is what breaks the infinite retry loop on 120+ tool sets via `mcpproxy-sovereign`.

#### 🤖 Agent — tool-call reliability

| Patch | Why | Files |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Gemini `const` schema sanitizer** | Gemini rejects `const` in `function_declarations.parameters`. Strips `const`, collapses `anyOf`-with-const → `enum`, drops `if/then/else`. | `crates/google_ai/src/completion.rs` |
| **Tool arg normalizer** | Models emit OpenAI/Anthropic field names (`working_directory`→`cd`, `file_path`→`path`, `query`→`regex`, `content`→`edits`); coerces string→u64 for `timeout_ms`. Kills `thread.rs:1635` validation errors. | `crates/agent/src/tools.rs`, `crates/agent/src/thread.rs` |
| **Terminal `cd` default** | Models that omit `cd` hit a deserialization error; `#[serde(default)]` falls back to `.`. | `crates/agent/src/tools/terminal_tool.rs` |

#### 🔍 Search

| Patch | Why | Files |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Grep respects `.ignore`** | Multi-GB JSONL/trajectory dirs OOM'd upstream grep; `.ignore` patterns merged into the exclusion matcher. | `crates/agent/src/tools/grep_tool.rs` |
| **ast-grep dev helpers** | Shell wrapper for regex + structural search; `--help` → JSON-schema parser. | `scripts/` |

#### ⚙️ Build & 🔄 Sync

| Area | Patch | Why | Files |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Build** | **sccache + mold** | Default `rustc-wrapper = sccache`, links with `-fuse-ld=mold`; cached build script for fast release rebuilds. | `.cargo/config.toml`, `script/build-release-cached` |
| **Sync** | **`sync-upstream.sh`** | Rebases patches onto latest `origin/main` and force-pushes `fork`. | `sync-upstream.sh` |

### What's *not* in this fork

Language model endpoints, provider configs (OpenRouter, NVIDIA NIM, Google, Mistral, etc.), and API URLs all live in **user settings** (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`) and deploy scripts — not in this git delta. Inference runs on **[herd](https://github.com/toxicwind/herd-main)** (`:25100`). No vLLM.

### Build quick start (≤3 commands)

```bash
cd /home/toxic/projects/zed
./script/build-release-cached
```

Requires `sccache` and `mold` on `PATH` (see `.cargo/config.toml`).

### Remotes

### Licensing

Zed source code is licensed primarily under GPL-3.0-or-later, with Apache-2.0 components where marked.

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you've created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate's Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license's requirements. If you're unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you've verified that this system is acceptable add the license's SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).
